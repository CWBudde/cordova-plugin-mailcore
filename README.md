# Cordova MailCore Plugin

This is a work-in-progress repository to expose MailCore as Cordova plugin some day. At the moment there is no real need for it as the other [Cordova MailCore2 Plugin](https://github.com/CWBudde/cordova-plugin-mailcore2/) seems to be working satisfying. However, I'll leave it here for anyone who wants to use this as base.

## Using

Install iOS platform

    cordova platform add ios

Install the plugin using any plugman compatible cli

    $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/CWBudde/cordova-plugin-mailcore.git
